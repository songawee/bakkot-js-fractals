bakkot-js-fractals
==================

Fractals and such, done in JavaScript with canvas. Almost all of these were written when I was very young and learning to code for the first time, but many are interesting visually despite very poor coding style.

Particularly notable are **Fern.html** and **Terrain.html**.
